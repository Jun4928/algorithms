# Binary Search Tree

- is a type of binary tree, but with certain rules

1. **All values in the left subtree are less than the value in the node**
2. **All values in the right subtree are greater than the value in the node**
3. **All values must be unique**

- O(logN): searching, adding, removing, using **binary search**
- a tree that had no right children and is just a straight line, the worst case O(N)

> Inorder DFS traversal prioritizing left before right in sorted orders

## Example 1: 938. Range Sum of BST
